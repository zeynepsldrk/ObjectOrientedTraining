# ObjectOrientedTraining

This repository includes example projects and exercises from the Udemy course **"Java ile Nesne-Merkezli Programlamaya Giriş"** (Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java), taught by **Akın Kaldıroğlu**. It aims to reinforce core object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts using the Java programming language.

The projects cover topics such as classes and objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, constructors, method overloading and overriding, and access modifiers.

The folder structure is organized according to the course sections. Each folder contains Java source files related to that specific topic. All projects can be opened and run in any Java-supported IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

This repository was created for personal learning and practice purposes during the course.
